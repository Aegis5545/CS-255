DriverPass was a project aimed at helping student drivers prepare for their future driving exams and scheduling practical driving test appointments. The client for this project was DriverPass, who wanted a website where users could create accounts, purchase study packages, take exams online, and schedule driving practice appointments. Employees of DriverPass also needed the ability to purchase packages for customers and schedule their appointments.

What I did well was creating easy-to-understand diagrams in the second project that really helped visually represent key concepts of the application.

If I had to revise one part of my work, I would add more limitations to my document. I feel like I definetely could've added a few more limitations (I.e. browser used, location, etc.)

To interpret the user's needs, I utilized technical requirements and interviews to create use cases and diagrams that aligned with these needs. It is crucial to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the primary users of the system, and meeting their needs is essential for the success of the project.

When designing software, I approach it by considering functional and non-functional requirements, creating use case, UML, and Gantt diagrams for visualization, and ensuring a thorough understanding of what the application should accomplish. In the future, I would continue to use these techniques and strategies for analyzing and designing systems.
